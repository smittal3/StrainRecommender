# StrainRecommender

This repo contains code for a recommendation engine for cannabis strains. Using the following dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains), given a set of input features, the model uses kNN to recommend similar strains. The web app for this application is still being built. 

Currently the model only uses content based filtering but eventually collaborative filtering will also be added to provide more accurate recommendations. 


### Uses
This recommendation engine can be used as at dispensaries to help users choose strains or even be marketed to users directly for recreational purposes (given that cannabis continues to be legalized). We could further interface this application with the Leafly or Weedmaps APIs to provide shops near users that contain the recommended strains.
